The .NET Common packages represent those common utilities, such as building packages, releasing
packages in a consistent way. It also includes a pre-configured system for static code analysis,
with all the rules that we at Dolittle consider important. These rules can be overridden.

In addition to the automatic configuration of static code analysis, it also holds custom built
code analysis rules.
